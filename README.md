# stock-analysis
Performing analysis on Stock data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
- Two Deliverables: technical deliverable and a written report  
      -- Techical Deliverble to Refactor VBA code and measure performances
      -- A written analysis of results (README.md)

Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
A. While there are 839 successful Theater campaigns
    1. May and June have the highest Theater rates of successful campaigns
B. While there are 37 total canceled Kickstarter campaigns
    1. Jan has the highest rate of Theater cancellations.
What can you conclude about the Play Outcomes based on Goals?
A. While there are three types of Theater campaigns (Plays, Musicals, and Space)
    1. No Plays were canceled.
B. While there are 694 successful Kickstarter plays, over 85% grossed less than $5000.
C. https://github.com/LaurasData/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png
What are some limitations of this dataset?
A. Moving and renaming formulas was time consuming
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A. Create a stacked Bar graph of types of theater campaigns canceled
B. Create a Box and Whiskers graph can show the outliers for this dataset
B. Create 
  

### Purpose
- To deliver a refactored VBA Code that speeds up the performances  


#### Analysis and Challenges
      - A huge challenge was getting the performances to show different years.
      - updates for refactoring include Elseif instead of End if

- Created pivot tables and grouping in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date and funding goals
- Grouped "Row Labels" by months in the Pivot table
- Created Year() from Conversion date

### Analysis of starting Price and Ending Price for Returns
I am not in agreement with this logic flow as we need to 
assign the min and max values and not the last and first rows.
   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
this whole challenge was botched with errors caused in GitHub to sync with my local directories
A Tutor session helped.

## Results

- What are two conclusions?
The logic flow for the VBA results:
While Substracting the beginning and ending prices will produce a value
   without a sorting funtion, I believe the first and last cell values are
   simply the first and last cells in that tricker range and not the min and max values
   the stock-analysis requires to meet reporting requirements.

- What can you conclude about?
While the Stock-Analysis array included all tickers,
    the array was a great scaffolding
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    There were two year (2017 & 2018) and the filters were on that caused errors
