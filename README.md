# stock-analysis
Performing analysis on Stock data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
- Two Deliverables: technical deliverable and a written report  
      -- Techical Deliverble to Refactor VBA code and measure performances
      -- A written analysis of results (README.md)


### Purpose
- To deliver a refactored VBA Code that speeds up the performances  


### Analysis and Challenges
      - A huge challenge was getting the performances to show different years.
      - updates for refactoring include Elseif instead of End if
      - Download challenge_starter_code.vbs and refactor for ElseIf

### Analysis of starting Price and Ending Price for Returns
      - I am not in agreement with this logic flow as we need to 
      - assign the min and max values and not the last and first rows.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
      - errors caused in Git Bash as sync with my local directories
      - Another Tutor session is recommended to solve for next assignments

## Results

- What are two conclusions?
      The logic flow for the VBA results:
      While Substracting the beginning and ending prices will produce a value
       without a sorting funtion, I believe the first and last cell values are
      simply the first and last cells in that tricker range and not the min and max values
      the stock-analysis requires to meet reporting requirements.

- What can you conclude about?
While the Stock-Analysis array included all tickers,
    the array was a great scaffolding
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    There were two year (2017 & 2018) and the filters were on that caused errors
