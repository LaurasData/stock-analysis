# stock-analysis
Performing analysis on Stock data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
- Two Deliverables: technical deliverable and a written report
<<<<<<< HEAD
  1. Techical Deliverble to Refactor VBA code and measure performances
  2. A written analysis of results (README.md)

=======
 1. Techical deliverable of Refactored VBA code to measure performances
 2. Written deliverable of Stock Analyst

### Purpose
- To deliver a refactored VBA Code that speeds up the performances  
#### Analysis and Challenges
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - A huge challenge was getting the performances to show different years.
    - - updates for refactoring include Elseif instead of End if
=======
- Created pivot tables and grouping in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date and funding goals
- Grouped "Row Labels" by months in the Pivot table
- Created Year() from Conversion date

### Analysis of starting Price and Ending Price for Returns
While Substracting the beginning and ending prices would give a first and last value
   without min and max funtions, the first and last cell values are
   the first and last cell values in that tricker range
   and does not meet with reporting requests.
   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
this whole challenge was completly botched by the errors caused in GitHub to sync with my local directories
A Tutor session helped.

## Results

- What are two conclusions?
The logic flow for the VBA results:
While Substracting the beginning and ending prices will produce a value
   without a sorting funtion, I believe the first and last cell values are
   simply the first and last cells in that tricker range and not the min and max values
   the stock-analysis requires to meet reporting requirements.

- What can you conclude about?
While the Stock-Analysis array included all tickers,
    the array was a great scaffolding
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    There were two year (2017 & 2018) and the filters were on that caused errors
