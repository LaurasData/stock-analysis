# stock-analysis
Performing analysis on Stock data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
-Two Deliverables: technical deliverable and a written report Readme.md to deliver your results.
--Deliverable 1: Refactor VBA code and measure performance
---This deliverable will include an updated workbook and a folder with PNGs of the pop-ups with script run time
--Deliverable 2: A written analysis of your results (README.md)

### Purpose

#### Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of starting Price and Ending Price for Returns
While Substracting the beginning and ending prices would give a first and last value
   without min and max funtions, the first and last cell values are
   the first and last cell values in that tricker range
   and does not meet with reporting requests.
   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions?
The logic flow for the VBA did not return correct results:
While Substracting the beginning and ending prices will produce a value
   without a sorting funtion, I believe the first and last cell values are
   simply the first and last cells in that tricker range and not the min and max values
   the stock-analysis requires to meet reporting requirements.

- What can you conclude about?
While the Stock-Analysis array included all tickers,
    the returns did not conclude findings of trends
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    There were two year (2017 & 2018) and the filters were on that caused errors

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
